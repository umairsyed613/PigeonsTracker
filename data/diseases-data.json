Symptoms include bloody or mucoid droppings, weight loss, ruffled feathers, and decreased appetite. Severe cases can be fatal.\n\n**Treatment:**\n- Amprolium (Corid) in drinking water for 5-7 days\n- Toltrazuril as a single-dose treatment\n- Sulfadimethoxine for severe cases\n- Provide B-vitamins during recovery\n- Clean and disinfect the loft thoroughly\n\n**Prevention:**\n- Keep loft dry and clean\n- Avoid overcrowding\n- Regular preventive treatments\n- Remove droppings regularly\n- Provide adequate ventilation"
